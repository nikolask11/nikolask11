### 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

I'm an early computer science learner exploring the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Python development**. I’m especially interested in how machines learn from data and make intelligent decisions.

### 🔧 What I'm Learning
- 🧠 **Machine Learning**: Neural networks, model training, and algorithm basics
- 🤖 **AI with Python**: Using libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn
- 📊 **Data Science Fundamentals**: Data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis
- 🛠️ **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tools

---

### 🚧 Projects
I'm currently working on:
- An **object recognizer**, but I'm just in the blueprint phase now.

---

### 🎯 Goals
- Master core concepts in Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Build impactful AI tools and projects with Python
- Contribute to open-source ML or AI educational tools
- Explore the ethics and transparency of AI systems

---

### 💡 Fun Fact
I'm fascinated by how machines can "see" images, "understand" patterns, and even "learn" over time. I'm always looking for the deeper logic behind how things work — not just how to use them.
