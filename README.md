### 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

I'm an early computer science learner diving deep into low-level systems and performance programming. Currently exploring **Assembly** and **Rust** to build a strong foundation in how computers really work.

---

### 🔧 What I'm Learning
- 🦀 **Rust**: Safety, speed, and system-level programming
- 🧠 **Assembly**: Understanding computing at the lowest level
- 🛠️ **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tools

---

### 🚧 Projects
I'm currently working on:
- A small **terminal-based calculator** in Rust
- An experiment with **emulating simple CPU instructions**
- A personal **notes parser** built in Rust for learning file I/O

---

### 🎯 Goals
- Master the Rust programming language
- Build solid low-level projects that show real skill
- Contribute to open-source Rust tools and libraries

---

### 💡 Fun Fact
I'm always curious about how things work under the hood—whether it's a line of code, a compiler, or a computer chip. I like figuring out the “why,” not just the “how.”
